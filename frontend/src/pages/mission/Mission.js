              We are a team of dedicated highschool students that each have at
              least two years of coding experience. Getting into coding at a
              young age is the best time to start, but for many it is difficult
              to know where to begin and how to structure their learning. Thatâ€™s
              where we come in. Our mission is to provide a primer into the
              coding world as well as to teach students to teach themselves.
              Each of our lessons will include homework that forces students to
              do some research on their own which will build on top of what they
              have learned in class. All of our classes will be held virtually
              to allow for more flexibility for both the students and teachers.
