    //                                 experience. Getting into coding at a young age
    //                                 is the best time to start, but for many, it is
    //                                 difficult to know where to begin and how to
    //                                 structure their learning. Thatâ€™s where we come
    //                                 in. Our mission is to provide an introduction
    //                                 into the coding world as well as to teach
    //                                 students to teach themselves. Each of our
    //                                 lessons will include homework that forces
    //                                 students to do some research on their own which
    //                                 will build on top of what they have learned in
    //                                 class. All of our classes will be held virtually
    //                                 to allow for more flexibility for both the
    //                                 students and teachers.

                            an online course. At first I was motivated by
                            wanting to build an ecommerce website. At the time,
                            I was really into gardening and wanted to create a
                            website where I could sell my vegetables.
                            Programming turned into an outlet for my creativity.
                            Today, knowing how to code has allowed me to build
                            whatever company ideas I have (perhaps too many)
                            which is why we created Codeocity. We wanted to
                            spread our passion to other people, so they can
                            enjoy this skill as much as we do."
