                    via Google Meet. Classes will also have no more than 4
                    students per teacher to allow for higher quality
                    instruction.&nbsp;
                    <b>
                        Refunds are available up until the course start date and

                    will be provided at no cost until said material is
                    appropriately taught.

                <p>
                    If a students misses a class, they are expected to read the
                    course slides (always provided at the end of a lesson) and
                    email the instructor if they have any further questions.
